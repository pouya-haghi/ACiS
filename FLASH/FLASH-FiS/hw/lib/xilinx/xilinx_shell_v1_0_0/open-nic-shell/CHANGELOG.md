# CHANGELOG

## [1.0] 2021-04-09

First public release.  Here are the changes compared with the last early-access
release version 0.4.2.

- Upgraded to Vivado 2020.2.
- Changed the AXI-stream interfaces between shell and user logic boxes.  See
  [README.md](https://github.com/Xilinx/open-nic-shell/blob/1.0/README.md) for
  details.
- Restructured the repo.  Now all the RTL code are under "open-nic-shell". The
  "open-nic" repo will become an umbrella for the OpenNIC project.
- Introduced a new approach to build the shell with user plugins.  See
  [README.md](https://github.com/Xilinx/open-nic-shell/blob/1.0/README.md) for
  details.
- Added support for build timestamp.  The timestamp is recorded automatically in
  the format 0xMMDD_HHMM, where the first MM is for month and the second for
  minute. It can be read from the register 0x0 via BAR2.
- Adjust RX insertion loss from 12dB to 20dB, so that longer cables can work
  more reliably.
- Enable RS-FEC on CMAC.
- Simulation code is removed and will be pushed into a separate repo.
