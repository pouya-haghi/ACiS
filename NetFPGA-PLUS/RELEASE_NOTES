GIT VERSION 1.0.0

This release contains:
1. Designs
  - reference design for L2 switch, router, nic on Alveo series FPGA cards
    (e.g., U200, U250, U280) and VCU1525
  - Linux driver (open-nic-driver), hardware testing and simulation enviroments are included.
  - library cores to build reference_switch, reference_switch_lite, reference_router, 
    reference_nic and simulation and hardware testings

2. Notes
  - For U280 board, please use 320MHz for reference_switch_lite project to fix timing closure,
    and use 300MHz for reference_router project to fix timing closure
    To change the running freq., please refer to each tcl file.
    e.g., NetFPGA-PLUS/hw/projects/reference_switch_lite/hw/tcl/reference_switch_lite.tcl
  - scone is not fully tested.
